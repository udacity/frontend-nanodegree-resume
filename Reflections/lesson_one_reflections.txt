this was cool--I never knew what the terminal was, and I went to http://guides.macrumors.com/Terminal to learn commands. The instructions don't explain cd but I was able to figure it out. Also saving the files in an easy space helped, Not in a folder but on the desktop

2. How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

just like in the first exercise, you can run a command to find differences and errors

3. What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

pros to automatic saving: don't have to remember to save

cons: could have too many versions without meaningful changes

4. Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

In Git the multiple files are all part of one project, in google docs they are separate projects, but if you have multiple tabs on a spreadsheet that is still saved as one workbook

5. How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log: shows the history of commits of one diff

git diff: compares 2 files so you can see what was added or deleted across its history


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
 you have the reassurance you can checkout earlier files and retrace your steps to before the mistake occurred

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

not sureâ€¦review history of existing projects
