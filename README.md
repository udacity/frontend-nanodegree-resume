Mock Resume

_Last updated 2015-08-07_


Synopsis
---
The goal of this **[Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/)** project is to use build an interactive resume using JavaScript and **[jQuery](https://jquery.com/)**. To help get started, Udacity provides a helper file that loads the content of the resume, including a Google Map that displays places lived. The student is to code the content as JSON objects, test it for syntax errors using **[JSLint.com](http://jsonlint.com/)** and use modular functions to append the content to a provided HTML template. The completed project should look like **[this example](http://i.imgur.com/pWU1Xbl.png)**, except with the student's original content and stylings.
