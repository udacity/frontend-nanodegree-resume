Synopsis
---
This project is a requirement of the front-end web developer program offered by **[Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/)**. The task is to use build an interactive resume using JavaScript and **[jQuery](https://jquery.com/)**. To help get started, Udacity provides a helper file that loads the content of the resume, including a Google Map that displays places lived. We are to code the content as JSON objects, test it for syntax errors using **[JSLint.com](http://jsonlint.com/)** and use modular functions to append the content to a provided HTML template. The completed project should look like **[this example](http://i.imgur.com/pWU1Xbl.png)**, except with our own content and stylings.
