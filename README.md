Requirement for this project to build a one page website with four sections (JSONs) and an interactive map of work locations. Additional information had to show up when you click on the pins in the map. The code for adding elements to the resume had to be within functions that were encapsulated within the same objects containing the resume data. 
Technologies: Javascript, jQuery

## How did I complete this project?

1. Go to the [Javascript Basics course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud804) and select "View Course Materials."
2. Go through the videos and assignments in this course to learn the JavaScript necessary to build the resume.
3. Review the work against the Project Rubric (on the next page).
4. When you are satisfied with the project, submit it according to the Submission Instructions on the next page.

### By the end:
the resume will look something like this

And the repository will include the following files:

* **index.html**: The main HTML document. Contains links to all of the CSS and JS resources needed to render the resume, including resumeBuilder.js.
* **js/helper.js**: Contains helper code needed to format the resume and build the map. It also has a few function shells for additional functionality. More on helper.js further down.
* **js/resumeBuilder.js**: This file is empty. You should write the code here.
* **js/jQuery.js**: The jQuery library.
* **css/style.css**: Contains all of the CSS needed to style the page.
* **README.md**: 
The GitHub readme file.
* and some images in the images directory.

## the starting point...
### js/helper.js
Within helper.js, you’ll find a large collection of strings containing snippets of HTML. Within many snippets, you’ll find placeholder data in the form of `%data%` or `%contact%`.

Each string has a title that describes how it should be used. For instance, `HTMLworkStart` should be the first `<div>` in the Work section of the resume. `HTMLschoolLocation` contains a `%data%` placeholder which should be replaced with the location of one of the schools.

### the process:
The resume has four distinct sections: work, education, projects and a header with biographical information. You’ll need to:

1. Build four JSONs, each one representing a different resume section. The objects that you create need to follow the names within the schema below exactly. Make sure the JSONs are formatted correctly using <a href="http://jsonlint.com/" target="_blank">JSONlint.com</a>.

* `bio` contains:
        
            name : string
            role : string
            contacts : an object with
                  mobile: string
                  email: string 
                  github: string
                  twitter: string 
                  location: string
            welcomeMessage: string 
            skills: array of strings
            biopic: url
            display: function taking no parameters

* `education` contains:
      
            schools: array of objects with
                 name: string
                 location: string
                 degree: string
                 majors: array of strings
                 dates: integer (graduation date)
                 url: string
            onlineCourses: array with
                 title: string
                 school: string
                 date: integer (date finished)
                 url: string
            display: function taking no parameters

* `work` contains
          
            jobs: array of objects with
                 employer: string 
                 title: string 
                 location: string 
                 dates: string (works with a hyphen between them)
                 description: string 
            display: function taking no parameters

* `projects` contains:

            projects: array of objects with
                  title: string 
                  dates: string (works with a hyphen between them)
                  description: string
                  images: array with string urls
            display: function taking no parameters

2. Iterate through each JSON and append its information to index.html in the correct section.
 * First off, you’ll be using jQuery’s `selector.append()` and `selector.prepend()` functions to modify index.html. `selector.append()` makes an element appear at the end of a selected section. `selector.prepend()` makes an element appear at the beginning of a selected section.
   * Pay close attention to the ids of the `<div>`s in index.html and the HTML snippets in helper.js. They’ll be very useful as jQuery selectors for `selector.append()` and `selector.prepend()`
* You’ll also be using the JavaScript method `string.replace(old, new)` to swap out all the placeholder text (e.g. `%data%`) for data from the resume JSONs.
* Here’s an example of some code that would add the location of one the companies to the page:
   * `var formattedLocation = HTMLworkLocation.replace("%data%", work.jobs[job].location);`
   * `$(".work-entry:last").append(formattedLocation);`
 * Use the mockup at the page of this document as a guide for the order in which you should append elements to the page.
3. The resume includes an interactive map. To add it, append the googleMap string to `<div id=”mapDiv”>`.
4. All of the code for adding elements to the resume should be within functions. And all of the functions should be encapsulated within the same objects containing the resume data. For instance, the functions for appending work experience elements to the page should be found within the same object containing data about the work experience.
5. the resume should also `console.log()` information about click locations. On line 90 in helper.js, you’ll find a jQuery onclick handler that you’ll need to modify to work with the `logClicks(x,y)` function above it.
6. It’s possible to make additional information show up when you click on the pins in the map. Check out line 174 in helper.js and the Google Maps API to get started.
