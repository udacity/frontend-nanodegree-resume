I can't wait to see the resumes you put together!

The <head> of a website generally links to important resources the page will
need to load. You'll see a lot of <link>s to CSS files for styles and
<scripts> for JavaScript files to build interactions.

  jQuery is a common JavaScript library for reading and making changes to the
  Document Object Model (DOM). The DOM is a tree that contains information
  about what is actually visible on a website.

  While HTML is a static document, the browser converts HTML to the
  DOM and the DOM can change. In fact, JavaScript's power comes from
  its ability to manipulate the DOM, which is essentially a JavaScript
  object. When JavaScript makes something interesting happen on a
  website, it's likely the action happened because JavaScript changed
  the DOM. jQuery is fast and easy to use, but it doesn't do anything
  you can't accomplish with vanilla (regular) JavaScript.

    Everything from here to the <script> tag below is the skeleton of your
    website. Your code will add information to each of the sections of the
    resume below. You can pretty easily figure out what each section will
    display by looking at the id or at what's written between the <h2> tags.

  The next line tells the browser where to download the JavaScript file you'll be
  writing. In resumeBuilder.js, you'll be writing code that builds the resume
  dynamically when this website, index.html, is opened.

  <!--
  These scripts are written in JavaScript. You'll be breaking them down as part of
  a quiz. Essentially, the next few lines are checking to see if you have not
  changed each section of the resume. If you have not made any changes to a section
  of the resume, then that part of the resume does not show up. More on this in the
  course.
